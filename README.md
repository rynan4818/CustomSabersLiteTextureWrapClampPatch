# CustomSabersLiteTextureWrapClampPatch
A patch that forcibly sets the TextureWrapMode of CustomTrail for CustomSabersLite to Clamp.

By default, this is disabled, so you will need to turn on the Enable setting for CustomSaberLite TextureClamp in MOD SETTINGS.

Created for the purpose of solving the problem at https://github.com/qqrz997/CustomSabersLite/issues/28

If possible, we recommend modifying the Saber model.
